# Binding report — `demo`

**1** components · ✅ **1** usable · 🔍 **0** need review · 🛑 **0** broken

**1** shared types deduplicated into **1** `*Types.res` modules (referenced qualified — no per-file redeclaration).

## 📦 Dependencies

| Kind | Package | Provides | Status |
|------|---------|----------|--------|
| required | `@rescript/react + stdlib` | JsxDOM, Dom, React, ReactEvent | ✓ present |
| optional | `rescript-webapi` | File, FileList | ✗ not installed |

## ✅ Usable

These compile and every prop is bound type-safely — use them directly.
_(n loose)_ = some props widened to `string`; they still work, just loosely typed.

- Handlers

## ⚪ Loosely typed (widened to `string`)

These resolved to a real but complex type and were widened to `string` (they compile and work). Grouped by type so you can review each pattern once — confirm `string` is acceptable, or it may deserve a tighter mapping.

_(none)_

## 🔍 Needs review

A multi-type prop couldn't be auto-discriminated at runtime (e.g. two object shapes), so an `@unboxed` variant won't work and we **refuse to use `%identity`/unsafe casts**. The prop is emitted as a `string` placeholder with an inline `// ⚠️ REVIEW` comment — bind it by hand or fix the type upstream.

_(none)_

## 🛑 Broken — needs serious component change

These props resolved to `unknown`/`any` (usually a generic `T`). They're emitted as a placeholder so the file still compiles, but **the props will not work as typed** — they need a concrete type upstream, or generic-binding support.

_(none)_ 🎉
